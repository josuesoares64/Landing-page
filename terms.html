                <h1>our <br> privacy policy</h1>
                <p>At CO&CO, we believe great ideas begin with trust. That’s why we’re committed to protecting your personal information with the same care and intention we bring to every campaign.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="terms">
            <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
            <p>CO&CO is a creative advertising agency specializing in strategic branding, design, and communication. This Privacy Policy applies to anyone who visits our website or interacts with our services, whether online or offline. For the purposes of this document, "we," "us," and "our" refer to CO&CO. Our website is [insert website URL], and you can contact us anytime at [insert email address] or at our office located at [insert physical address].</p>
            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide when you contact us, fill out a form, subscribe to a newsletter, or engage our services. This may include your name, email address, phone number, company name, and job title. Additionally, when you use our website, we may automatically collect certain data such as your IP address, browser type, device information, and the pages you visit. We also use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your browsing experience and better understand how users engage with our content.</p>
            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use your personal information to communicate with you, respond to your inquiries, and provide the services you request. Your data helps us operate effectively, improve our website, tailor our content, and deliver relevant updates. If you subscribe to our communications, we may also send occasional newsletters, offers, or updates—always with the option to unsubscribe. In addition, we may use your data to fulfill legal obligations or support our internal business analytics.</p>
            <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
            <p>We process your personal data under several legal bases. When you give us consent, such as by opting into marketing communications, that consent allows us to process your data. If we’re working together under a contract, we may need to use your information to fulfill our obligations to you. In some cases, we rely on legitimate interest—for example, to improve our services and understand how users interact with our site. We may also process data when required to comply with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
            <h2>5. Sharing Your Data</h2>
            <p>

We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may share data with trusted third-party service providers who assist us with operations such as website hosting, analytics, or email delivery—but only when those providers are under strict confidentiality agreements. We may also disclose information when legally obligated to do so, or when necessary to protect our legal rights, safety, or property.</p>
<h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. For example, we may keep general inquiries for up to twelve months and retain client-related data for up to five years for reference and legal purposes. If you’ve subscribed to our marketing communications, we will keep your contact details until you unsubscribe or request deletion. You can ask us to delete your data at any time.</p>
<h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. You can also object to certain types of processing, withdraw your consent at any time, or request that your data be transferred to another provider. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [insert email address], and we will respond promptly and in accordance with applicable laws</p>
<h2>8. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>We use cookies and similar technologies to understand how users interact with our site and to improve functionality. These small files are stored on your device and may track user behavior, preferences, or session information. You can choose to accept or reject cookies by adjusting your browser settings, though some website features may not function properly if cookies are disabled. For more information, please refer to our separate Cookie Policy [insert link if available].</p>
<h2>9. Data Security</h2>
<p>We take your privacy seriously and have implemented technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These include secure servers, encryption technologies, and strict access controls. While we strive to maintain a high level of security, no online transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection. If you suspect a security issue or breach, please notify us immediately.</p>
<h2>10. Third-Party Links</h2>
<p>Our website may include links to third-party sites such as social media platforms, portfolio showcases, or partner pages. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those external websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit before sharing personal information with them.</p>
<h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Our services are not directed at children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If we become aware that we have collected data from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete it immediately.</p>
<h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect legal changes, improvements to our practices, or updates to our services. Any changes will be published on this page, and the “Last Updated” date below will be revised accordingly. We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed.</p>
